# mare_vox : Fisherman's Weather App (Flutter)

This project aims to develop a mobile application (iOS and Android) for saltwater fishermen to access real-time and forecast weather data for chosen sea areas. The app leverages free weather data APIs and NOAA sea chart data to provide basic functionalities essential for planning successful fishing trips.
